The 'x' and 'y' are lists containing the original data's x and y values respectively, whereas 'x_interp' contains x-values for which interpolation is desired. The routine starts with an empty 'y_interp' list for the interpolated values. As it processes each 'xi' from 'x_interp', it locates its interval within 'x', and computes the interpolated y-value 'yi' using the formula: 'y[i] + (y[i+1] - y[i]) * (xi - x[i]) / (x[i+1] - x[i])'. This 'yi' is then appended to 'y_interp', and the filled list is eventually returned."", ""Utilize the function 'interpolate_1d', accepting parameters 'x', 'y', and 'x_interp', to achieve linear interpolation of one-dimensional data. Both 'x' and 'y' lists represent the original data's x and y coordinates, and 'x_interp' includes the x-coordinates for desired interpolation. The function initializes a blank list 'y_interp' for the interpolated values. For every 'xi' in 'x_interp', it iterates through 'x' to pinpoint the segment where 'xi' falls between 'x[i]' and 'x[i+1]', calculating the interpolated y-value 'yi' through: 'yi = y[i] + (y[i+1] - y[i]) * (xi - x[i]) / (x[i+1] - x[i])', and appending each 'yi' to 'y_interp'.

The BMI computation is carried out through the 'get_BMI' method using the user's weight and height. Following BMI calculation, the sex of the user is examined to extract the corresponding BMI acceptable range from 'self.BMI_std'. A result of 1 is given if BMI goes beyond the high limit of 'BMI_range[1]', -1 if it's less than the low limit of 'BMI_range[0]', and 0 signifies a normal condition."", ""Ascertain the user's BMI classification relative to sex-specific standards ('male' or 'female'), where a return of 1 denotes too fat, -1 too thin, and 0 normal. Initially, BMI is deduced through 'get_BMI', considering the user's height and weight. The sex determination follows, selecting the relevant BMI range from 'self.BMI_std'. If the BMI exceeds the defined upper level in 'BMI_range[1]', it results in a return of 1. If below the specified lower boundary in 'BMI_range[0]', the return is -1. If within bounds, a return of 0 indicates normality."", ""Apply gender-based BMI standards ('male' or 'female') to classify the user's weight condition, returning 1 for obesity, -1 for underweight, and 0 for normal weight. At first, the user's BMI is calculated via 'get_BMI', based on their body metrics. Afterward, depending on the user's gender, the appropriate BMI range is retrieved from 'self.BMI_std'. Should the BMI overstep the 'BMI_range[1]', the function generates a return of 1, signaling excessive weight. If the BMI is below 'BMI_range[0]', it results in a -1, indicating insufficient weight. Otherwise, a 0 is returned, showing the user's weight is normal.""]"

The function checks if the JWT token starts with the name under 'token['user']['name']'. It then utilizes this name to bisect the JWT, obtaining 'jwt_str_date'. This date string is formulated into 'jwt_date', a datetime object, through datetime formatting '%Y-%m-%d'. If today's date minus 'jwt_date' falls within three days or less, it returns the data from 'token'; if not, it outputs 'None' indicating that the token is expired or invalid."", ""Fetch user info from a JWT by starting with the token from 'request['headers']['Authorization']'.
