The regular expression pattern `(?<!\\w\\.\\w.)(?<![A-Z][a-z]\\.)(?<=\\.|\\?)\\s` is used to match the end of a sentence. It checks for the following conditions:\n\n- `(?<!\\w\\.\\w.)`: This ensures that a period is not part of an abbreviation.\n- `(?<![A-Z][a-z]\\.)`: This ensures that a period is not part of an abbreviation.\n- `(?<=\\.|\\?)`: This ensures that the sentence ends with a period or a question mark.\n- `\\s`: This ensures that the sentence ends with a space.\n\nThe `re.split` function is then used to split the input string into a list of sentences based on the regular expression pattern. The resulting list of sentences is then returned.<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>", "1": "<\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>Below is an instruction that describes a task.

If the input `key` is not a string, we return it unchanged.\n\nIn the `_to_camel_case` method, we split the input `key` string into words by underscores, then capitalize the first letter of each word except the first one and join them together.

Then, we compute the cosine similarity between the first vector and each vector in the list. The cosine similarity is the dot product of the two vectors, divided by the product of their lengths. The result is a list of cosine similarities, which is then converted to a numpy array and returned.<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>", "4": "<\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>Below is an instruction that describes a task.

The approximation is based on the formula:\n\ncos(x) = 1 - x^2/2! + x^4/4! - x^6/6! + ...\n\nWe calculate this by summing up the terms of the series up to a certain number of terms (in this case, 100). Each term is calculated by taking the factorial of the current term number (2n) and dividing by the factorial of the next term number (2n+1).

If not, it returns \"Invalid input\". Then it replaces '-' and 'and' with spaces to make the textnum string easier to split.\n\nIt then iterates over each word in the textnum string. If the word is an ordinal word, it sets the scale_num to the corresponding number. If the word is an ordinal ending, it sets the scale_num to the corresponding number. If the word is not in the numwords dictionary, it returns \"Invalid input\".\n\nIf the scale is greater than 1, it sets the scale_unit to the scale and resets the scale_num to 0. If the scale is 1, it adds the increment to the scale_num. If the scale_num is greater than or equal to 1000, it adds the current number to the result, resets the current number to 0, sets the scale_unit to 1000, and resets the scale_num to 0.\n\nFinally, it adds the current number to the result and returns the result as a string.<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>", "45": "<\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>Below is an instruction that describes a task.

If either of these conditions is true, we return `diff - 1` as the length of the palindromic substring.\n\nIf the characters at the current position and the center are the same, we recursively call `palindromic_length` with `center`, `diff + 1`, and `string`. This continues until we find a position where the characters at the current position and the center are not the same, at which point we return `diff - 1` as the length of the palindromic substring.<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>", "52": "<\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>Below is an instruction that describes a task.

The size of each block is the integer division of the length of the list by the number of partitions, and the remainder is the modulus of the length of the list by the number of partitions.\n\nWe then calculate the start and end positions of the block based on the index. The start position is the index times the size of each block, and the end position is the start position plus the size of each block. If the index is less than the remainder, we increment the end position by 1.\n\nFinally, we return the corresponding block from the list.<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>", "73": "<\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>Below is an instruction that describes a task.

The `filter` function applies a function to all items in an input list and returns a list with only those items for which the function returns `True`. In this case, the function checks if each character is in the string '01'. If it is, the character is included in the output list. If it is not, the character is excluded.\n\nThe `join` function then concatenates all the characters in the list into a single string.\n\nThis method modifies the `self.binary_string` attribute of the class instance, effectively cleaning it of all non-binary characters.<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>", "118": "<\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>Below is an instruction that describes a task.

This is to handle even length palindromes. Then, we initialize an array `P` of length `n` with all elements as 0. `P[i]` will hold the length of the longest palindromic substring centered at `i`.\n\nWe then iterate over the characters of the new string. For each character, we calculate the length of the longest palindromic substring centered at that character. If the current palindrome extends beyond the current right boundary `R`, we update `C` and `R`.\n\nFinally, we find the maximum length in `P` and return the substring corresponding to that maximum length. The substring is obtained by removing the '#' and '^' characters from the original string.<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>", "154": "<\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>Below is an instruction that describes a task.

If not, we return `False`. Then, we use the bitwise AND operator (`&`) to check if the `stat` is a subset of `states`. If `stat` is a subset of `states`, the result will be equal to `stat`, and we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>", "160": "<\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>Below is an instruction that describes a task.

The `?` is a placeholder for the username, and the `(username,)` is a tuple containing the username.\n\nThe `fetchall` method is then called on the cursor to retrieve all rows that match the query.

Finally, the result is reversed back to its original order and returned.<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>", "171": "<\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>Below is an instruction that describes a task.

Each element in the tuple should represent whether an answer is correct (1) or incorrect (0), and the total count of ground truth responses.

It checks the type of the input data and calls the appropriate helper method. The helper methods `_map_single` and `_map_list` are used to calculate the MAP for a single tuple or a list of tuples, respectively. The MAP is calculated by sorting the actual results in descending order, taking the top `total` results, and then calculating the average precision (AP) for each result. The MAP for a single tuple is the mean of these AP values, and the MAP for a list of tuples is the mean of the MAPs for each tuple.<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>", "196": "<\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>Below is an instruction that describes a task.
