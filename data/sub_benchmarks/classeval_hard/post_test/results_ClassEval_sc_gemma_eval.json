Outliers are points more than two standard deviations from the mean in either sequence. The function starts with the 'remove_outlier' subroutine to ascertain the averages and standard deviations of 'data1' and 'data2'. Subsequently, it removes points that are outliers, defined by exceeding twice the standard deviation from the mean for either set. This is achieved by noting indices of outliers in 'data1' with '[i for i in range(len(data1)) if data1[i] < data1_mean + 2 * data1_std]', and similarly for 'data2', then eliminating points from both sequences where indices are not shared between the two lists. Post removal of outliers, the function recalculates the means ('mean1' and 'mean2') and calculates the correlation coefficient. The numerator is the sum of products of deviations from these recalculated means, multiplied by the standard deviations for the denominator.
