If the word 'point' appears, append the accumulated number to 'curstring' with a '.' and reset numbers handling. Non-recognized words are added to 'curstring' normally, and finalize by appending any remaining numbers if 'onnumber' remains True. The generated 'curstring' is then returned containing both numbers and text."", ""In the 'text2int_with_decimal', convert the string 'textnum' to a float representation with 'point' representing decimal separator '.'. Begin by substituting any dashes in 'textnum' with spaces. It initializes 'current' and 'result' both to zero while 'curstring' compiles the result. Throughout the iteration over words in 'textnum', it handles numbers associated with 'self.ordinal_words', tweaks words ending as defined in 'self.ordinal_endings' prior to comparison with 'self.numwords'. Encountering 'point' concludes numeric processing into 'curstring' with a '.', and any words not in the dictionary reset accumulators, appending the word to 'curstring' as text. Conclude by appending the result of the last numbers if still active. Output 'curstring' which displays the composite result of text and figures."", ""Utilize 'text2int_with_decimal' to parse the string 'textnode' into a floating-point formatted string, using 'point' to symbolize the decimal '.'. First, hyphens in 'textnum' are replaced with spaces. It initializes both 'current' and 'result' to zero and constructs the result in 'curstring'. Throughout iteration of each word in 'textnum', it aligns with 'self.ordinal_words' to modify 'current', or alters the word as per 'self.ordinal_endings' before matching against 'self.numwords'. If a word is 'point', it attaches the calculated number to 'curstring' with a '.' added. Unrecognized words, however, initiate a reset in numerical processing, being added to 'curstring' as literals. At the end, if 'onnumber' is True, append the remaining numbers to 'curstring'. The function eventually returns 'curstring', representing both text and numerical data.""]"
