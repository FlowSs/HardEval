If the `where` parameter is not `None`, it assembles a single condition string by integrating each key-value combination in the dictionary. This condition is then added to the DELETE query. The method then inserts a log record into the `log_table` using the `table_name` and `condition` values.\n\nThe final step is to return the complete SQL query, which combines both the DELETE and INSERT statements by separating them with a semicolon.</s>", "<s> [INST]Below is an instruction that describes a task.

The method takes in an `age` parameter and an `exclude_names` parameter, both of which are lists. The method first creates a filter string that includes all three conditions:\n\n1. `gender = 'female'`: This ensures that only female records are selected.\n2. `age < {age}`: This ensures that only records with an age less than the specified `age` are selected.\n3. `name NOT IN {tuple(exclude_names)}`: This ensures that only records with names that are not in the `exclude_names` list are selected.\n\nThe method then calls the `select` method of the `SQLGenerator` class, passing in the filter string as the `condition` parameter and the `fields` parameter set to `[\"*\"]`. This instructs the `select` method to retrieve all columns (`fields` set to `[\"*\"]`) from the table where the filter string is true (`condition` set to the filter string). The method returns the generated SQL statement.</s>", "<s> [INST]Below is an instruction that describes a task.
