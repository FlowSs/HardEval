If 'f_list' doesn't consist of exactly two entries, or if its first part is blank, or its first character isn't a letter, or it has an uppercase (checked by 'isupper'), or its second item isn't either 'txt', 'exe', or 'dll', then it returns 'No'. It reports 'Yes' otherwise."", ""Fabricate a function labeled 'file_name_check_no_uppercape' accepting a string 'file_name' that signifies a file's name and appraises whether it conforms to various rules, returning 'Yes' for compliance and 'No' for non-compliance. First, it utilizes a lambda in a filter to enumerate digits in 'file_name', disqualifying those exceeding three digits by returning 'No'. Next, it cracks 'file_name' at the decimal point into 'f_list'. If 'f_list' doesn't hold exactly two units, or its forefront unit is barren, or its primary character isn't alphabetic, or holds an uppercase character checked by 'isupper', or the terminal element isn't 'txt', 'exe', or 'dll', then it returns 'No'. Successively passing all checks results in a 'Yes'."", ""Write a program named 'file_name_tech_no_uppercase' in the form of a function accepting a string 'file_name' to evaluate if a file name is valid based on certain criteria, returning 'Yes' if it is and 'No' if not. It starts by using a filter with a lambda to count the number of digits in 'file_name', rejecting those with more than three digits with a 'No'. Following this, it splits 'file_name' at the period into 'f_list'. If 'f_list' isn't composed of precisely two components, or the initial component is empty, or its first character isn't alphabetic, or it contains an uppercase detected by 'isupper', or the second component isn't 'txt', 'exe', or 'dll', the function returns 'No'. It acknowledges with 'Yes' if all checks are cleared.""]"
