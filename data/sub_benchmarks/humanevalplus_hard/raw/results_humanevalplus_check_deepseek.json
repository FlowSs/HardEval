If the number of words is not the same, the function again returns `False`. Finally, it checks if the sorted list of characters in each string, excluding spaces and the last character, is the same.

The function uses a regular expression pattern to find all words in the strings that end with an alphabetical character. The pattern `\\b(\\w)(\\w*[a-zA-Z])\\b` matches any word that ends with an alphabetical character, with the word and the last character captured separately.

If either string doesn't meet these conditions, the original function immediately returns false.
