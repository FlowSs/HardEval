The function returns 'Yes' if the file name complies with specific criteria, and 'No' if it doesn't. Initially, the function evaluates if there are no more than three digits in 'file_name' by applying a lambda function for digit detection. The file name is segmented by '.' into 'f_list'. The function will return 'No' if 'f_list' is not exactly composed of two parts, if the first component is void, or does not begin with a character. Moreover, the function checks if 'f_list'[1] includes one of the following ['txt', 'exe', 'dll'], and uses a generator 'any' to see if 'f_list'[0] contains vowels 'aeiouAEIOU'.

The function first checks if the file name contains no more than three digits by using a regular expression to find all digits in the file name. If there are more than three digits, the function returns 'No'.\n2. The function then splits the file name at the period using the `split()` method.\n3.

If the file extension is not valid, the function returns 'No'.\n5. The function then checks if the file name contains any vowels by using a generator expression to check if any vowel is present in the first entry of the file name.
