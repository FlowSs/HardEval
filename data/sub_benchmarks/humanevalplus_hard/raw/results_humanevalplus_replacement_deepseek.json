If the character is an alphabet letter, it is shifted down by 4 and then by 5 places.

If the character is an alphabet letter, it is shifted down by 4 and 5 places respectively using the ASCII values of the letters. If the letter is lowercase, the ASCII value of 'a' is subtracted to get a value from 0 to 25, and 4 and 9 are subtracted. If the letter is uppercase, the ASCII value of 'A' is subtracted. The modulo operator is used to wrap the value around to the start of the alphabet if it exceeds 26.

If `char` is a vowel, it modifies it to the next but one letter in the alphabet (A -> B, E -> F, etc.). The resultant character is then appended to the `encoded` string. If `char` is not an alphabet character, it is directly appended to the `encoded` string.

If it is, it converts to uppercase by subtracting 32 from its ASCII value, and if it's uppercase, it converts to lowercase by adding 32 to its ASCII value.\n4. If the character is a vowel (either lowercase or uppercase), it checks if it's a lowercase vowel. If it is, it advances it by 4 alphabets (lower or uppercase), by adding 4 to its ASCII value. If it's an uppercase vowel, it goes back 4 alphabets by subtracting 4 from its ASCII value.\n5. If the character is neither an alphabet nor a vowel, it is simply appended as is to the `result` string.\n6.

It contains two helper functions: `toggle_case` and `advance_vowel`. The `toggle_case` function takes a character and returns its case-switched version; `advance_vowel`, on the other hand, takes a character and if it's a vowel, it advances it by two positions in the alphabet (it wraps around to 'a' after 'y' and 'z').\n\nThe main function works by first reversing the input string.

Then, another helper function \"vowel_change(ch)\" is used to replace each vowel (\"aeiouAEIOU\") in the message with the character that is two positions ahead of it in the English alphabet. After applying these transformations to the message, the result is reversed. The reversed encoded message is then returned as the final output. The function uses the \"map\" function to apply \"switch_case\" and \"vowel_change\" to the entire message.\n```\n\nEnclose your solution in ```python and ```. Only print the function.

They are then used in combination with the `map()` function to apply these transformations to each character in the original message. The result is reversed and returned.\n\nThe modification for vowels is done by changing the ASCII values of the characters. Lowercase 'a' corresponds to ASCII 97, so 'ch' is offset by 97 and the '+2' adds 2 to its ASCII value. Then the modulo operator is used to ensure that the ASCII value loops back to 'a' after reaching 'y'. Finally, the ASCII value is offset back by 97 to get the corresponding character.\n<|EOT|>", "<\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>You are an expert Python programmer.Your task is to write a Python function to solve a programming problem.\n### Instruction\nWrite a Python solution to the following problem:\n```\nConstruct a function called 'encode_reversed' that accepts a string parameter 'message'.

The `ord` function returns the ASCII value of a character, and `chr` does the reverse. The transformations are done by subtracting 94 from the ASCII value (to bring it to the range 65-90), adding 65 (to bring it back to the range A-Z), taking the modulus 26 to wrap around to the start of the alphabet if necessary, and finally converting back to a character with `chr`.

This is done using helper functions `shift_case` and `shift_vowel`, respectively. Then it rearranges the string in groups of three characters, moving the first character to the end of the group. Finally, the groups are joined back together into a string.\n\nNote: The encoded string is not strictly a base64-encoded string, as base64 encoding is a binary-to-text encoding scheme that is designed to encode binary data.

The final restructured string is returned.\n<|EOT|>", "<\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>You are an expert Python programmer.Your task is to write a Python function to solve a programming problem.\n### Instruction\nWrite a Python solution to the following problem:\n```\nWrite 'encode_cyclic_shift' function that takes 's' string input.

The function `switch_case` changes the case of all characters in a given string.\n\n2. The `vowel_change` function goes through each character in the string and, if it's a vowel (checked using the `vowels` string), it replaces it with the character two places forward in the alphabet. If the character is 'y' or 'Y', it cycles back to 'a' or 'A' respectively.\n\n3. The `encode_cyclic_shift` function applies these transformations to the input string `s`, splits the result into groups of three characters, and then cycles the first character of each group to the back for even-indexed groups and leaves it in place for odd-indexed groups. The resulting groups are then concatenated and returned.\n<|EOT|>", "<\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>You are an expert Python programmer.Your task is to write a Python function to solve a programming problem.\n### Instruction\nWrite a Python solution to the following problem:\n```\nConstruct the 'encode_cyclic_shift' function to manipulate a given string 's'.

If the character is a letter, it swaps its case and then checks if it's a vowel by seeing if it's in the string `vowels`. If it is, it moves it two places forward in the alphabet by converting it to an integer ASCII value, adding 2, and then converting it back to a character. It then adds the transformed character to the string `result`. If the character is not a letter, it simply adds it to `result` unchanged. Finally, it returns `result` reversed.\n\nNote that `ord` is a built-in Python function that returns the ASCII value of a character and `chr` is the inverse: they are used to handle the conversion of the letters to and from their ASCII values. The modulo operation (`%`) is used to handle the wrap-around effect when the letter becomes 'z' (it wraps back to 'a').\n<|EOT|>", "<\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>You are an expert Python programmer.Your task is to write a Python function to solve a programming problem.\n### Instruction\nWrite a Python solution to the following problem:\n```\nDesign a function 'solve_with_vowel' to process a string 's'.

If it is, `shift_alpha(c)` is called that flips its case and if it is a vowel, increases its position by two. In `shift_alpha(c)`, the `v` variable contains all the vowels in lowercase. If the character is in `v`, then it's a vowel and its position in the alphabet is increased by two (using the modulus operation to handle the wrapping around effect like Z+2 becomes A). If the character is not in `v`, it returns the same character.\n\nFinally, the function returns the reversed version of `s` if it doesn't contain any alphabetic characters; otherwise, it returns the un-reversed version of `s`. It does this by checking if any character in `s_alpha` is an alphabet letter using `any(x.isalpha() for x in s_alpha)`.

This function checks if the given character `c` is a vowel by seeing if its lowercase version is in the string 'aeiou'. If it is, the function uses `ord` to find the Unicode integer equivalent of the character, adds two to it, then converts back to a character using `chr`. If `c` is not a vowel, the function returns `c` unchanged.\n\nThe `solve_with_vowel` function checks whether any of the characters in `s` are alphabetic using the `any` function with a generator that checks `.isalpha()` for each character in `s`. If no alphabetic characters are found, the function returns the reversed version of `s` by using slice notation with a step of -1. If alphabetic characters are found, the function uses a generator comprehension to transform each character in `s` using the `vowel_shift` function, and then joins the resulting characters back together into a string using the `join` method.\n<|EOT|>", "<\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>You are an expert Python programmer.Your task is to write a Python function to solve a programming problem.\n### Instruction\nWrite a Python solution to the following problem:\n```\nDevelop a function 'solve_with_vowel' that accepts a string parameter 's'.

The main function `solve_with_vowel()` iterates through the input string, converting each letter by swapping its case and applying `vowel_change()`, and appending the result to the `ans` string. It then checks if there are any letters in `ans` by using the built-in `any()` function and the `isalpha()` method, and returns `ans` if there are, otherwise returns `ans` reversed.\n<|EOT|>", "<\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>You are an expert Python programmer.Your task is to write a Python function to solve a programming problem.\n### Instruction\nWrite a Python solution to the following problem:\n```\nWrite a function called 'solve_with_vowel' which requires a string 's' as input.

The 'vowel_change' function checks if a character c is a vowel. If c is a vowel, it gets its ASCII representation, increments it by one, and uses a modulo operation to loop back to the start of the alphabet when necessary. It then uses the chr function to convert the ASCII code back to a character. If c is not a vowel, it returns c as it is.\n\nThe 'solve_with_vowel' function iterates over each character c in the string s. If c is a letter, it sets 'has_letter' to True and appends the result of 'vowel_change(c)' to 'ans'. If c is not a letter, it appends c as it is. Finally, it returns 'ans' reversed if no letters were found in 's', and returns 'ans' as is otherwise.\n<|EOT|>"]}}
