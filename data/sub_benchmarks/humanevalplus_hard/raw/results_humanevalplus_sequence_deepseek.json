For example, `prime_fib4(-1)` will return the last number in the sequence.\n\nThis solution defines a helper function `is_prime` to check if a number is prime, and a helper function `get_next_prime_fib4` to generate the next prime number in the sequence according to the special Fibonacci-like rule. The main function `prime_fib4` initializes the sequence and calls `get_next_prime_fib4` to generate and return the n-th prime number in the sequence.\n<|EOT|>", "<\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>You are an expert Python programmer.Your task is to write a Python function to solve a programming problem.\n### Instruction\nWrite a Python solution to the following problem:\n```\nWrite a function named 'prime_fib4' that returns the n-th element in a sequence where each term is a prime number, derived from a special Fibonacci-like series defined by the sum of the previous four terms, starting with initial terms 0, 1, 1, and 2 for n equals to 0, 1, 2, 3.\n```\n\nEnclose your solution in ```python and ```.

Then it initializes a list `fib` with the first four Fibonacci numbers. It also initializes two variables `prime_count` and `i`, `prime_count` to count the number of prime numbers encountered, and `i` to keep track of the current index in the list.\n\nThe function then enters a loop where it calculates the next Fibonacci number by adding the last four Fibonacci numbers, adds this new number to the list, and checks if it's a prime number. If it is, it increments `prime_count`. The function continues this process until `prime_count` equals `n`, at which point it returns the `n-th` prime number.\n\nPlease note that this function uses an integer division (`//`) and modulo (`%`) operations, which are more efficient than floating point division (`/`) and modulo (`%`) operations. Additionally, the function checks if a number is a prime by dividing it by all numbers up to its square root, which is more efficient than checking all numbers up to `n`.\n<|EOT|>", "<\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>You are an expert Python programmer.Your task is to write a Python function to solve a programming problem.\n### Instruction\nWrite a Python solution to the following problem:\n```\nDesign the function 'prime_fib4' that takes an integer n, and outputs the n-th term from a series that extends the Fibonacci sequence by summing the last four items, beginning with 0, 1, 1, and 2 for n equals to 0, 1, 2, 3.

It then defines the `prime_fib4` function which starts a fib_sequence list with the initial four values and adds to it the sum of the last four numbers in the sequence each iteration. It also increments a counter `prime_count` each time a prime number is found, and continues until `prime_count` equals the input number `n`. Note that the index `i` used in the loop starts at 3 and increases for each addition to the sequence, making it 0-based.

Then it defines the outer function `prime_fib4(n)` which checks if `n` is less than 0; if so, it returns `None`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, it sets the initial values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` to the first four terms of the sequence and initiates a counter `count` to keep track of the number of prime numbers found. It then enters a while loop that continues until the `n`th prime number in the sequence is found. The current term `e` is calculated as the sum of the terms `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The value of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are then updated to the next terms in the sequence. If `e` is prime, the counter `count` is incremented.

This is done by using an inner function 'is_prime' to check if a number is prime. The 'prime_fib4' function iterates through the sequence, generating the next term by summing the last four terms. The function checks if this new term is prime and if it is, it increments the prime count. The function keeps iterating until it has generated the nth prime number. The function returns this nth prime number.\n<|EOT|>", "<\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>You are an expert Python programmer.Your task is to write a Python function to solve a programming problem.\n### Instruction\nWrite a Python solution to the following problem:\n```\nDesign a function 'prime_fib4' that intakes an integer 'n' and returns the n-th element in a sequence commencing with 0, 1, 1, and 2 for 'n' equals to 0, 1, 2, 3, further proceeding by each term being the aggregate of the prior four terms.

The function first handles the base cases where n is 0, 1, or 2. Then, it uses two lists `fibfib_sequence` and `tri_sequence` to store the first three numbers of the FibFib and tri sequences. After that, it computes the nth number in the sequence using a for loop. If n is even, the tri value is calculated as `i // 2 + 1`. If n is odd, the tri value is calculated as the sum of the last two terms of the tri sequence plus 1. Finally, the function returns the nth number in the FibFib sequence.\n<|EOT|>", "<\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>You are an expert Python programmer.Your task is to write a Python function to solve a programming problem.\n### Instruction\nWrite a Python solution to the following problem:\n```\nCreate a function 'tri_ffigib' which computes the nth entry of a sequence called FibFib.

The function begins by initializing the first two elements of the sequence. It then iterates over the remaining elements, calculating each one based on the position and previous elements. If the position is even, the element is calculated as 1 plus half the position. If the position is odd, the element is calculated as the sum of the last two elements, plus one, and half the next position.\n\nAfter generating the sequence, the function removes any elements that are divisible by 7 by creating a new list that only includes elements for which the remainder of their division by 7 is not zero.

The main function ```get_odd_prime_fib_collatz()``` first calls ```get_nth_prime_fib()``` to get the n-th prime Fibonacci number. Then it generates the Collatz sequence based on this prime Fibonacci number and collects the odd numbers in a set. Finally, it sorts the set and returns the sorted list of odd numbers in the Collatz sequence.\n<|EOT|>", "<\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>You are an expert Python programmer.Your task is to write a Python function to solve a programming problem.\n### Instruction\nWrite a Python solution to the following problem:\n```\nConstruct a function named 'get_odd_prime_fib_collatz' which first establishes the n-th prime Fibonacci number, then computes a sorted list of odd values from its Collatz sequence.

The sequence is computed using a for loop that appends the next number based on whether the current index is even or odd. If the index is even, the next number is computed as `sequence[i] + 1 + (i / 2)`. If the index is odd, the next number is computed as `sequence[i] + sequence[i - 1] + 1 + ((i + 1) / 2)`.

If the index of the sequence is even, the value is calculated as `1 + index // 2`, otherwise it is calculated as the sum of the last two numbers in the sequence plus `1 + index // 2`.\n\nIf the calculated value is a Fibonacci number (checked by `is_fibonacci`), it is appended to the sequence.

It then initializes a list with the first two elements of the sequence [1, 3]. The function then generates the remainder of the sequence by iterating through each index from 2 to 'n' (inclusive), and determining whether it's even or odd. For even indices, the new value is derived as 1 plus half the index; for odd indices, the new value is the sum of the two previous entries, 1, and half the following index. The function also incorporates a helper function 'is_fibonacci' through a Binet formula to validate each generated value as a Fibonacci number. If a generated value doesn't meet this criteria, it's removed from the sequence. The function returns the final sequence of 'n' elements.\n<|EOT|>", "<\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>You are an expert Python programmer.Your task is to write a Python function to solve a programming problem.\n### Instruction\nWrite a Python solution to the following problem:\n```\nDevelop the 'tri_fib' function to enumerate elements of the Tri series that also belong in the Fibonacci sequence through to the 'n + 1' element.
