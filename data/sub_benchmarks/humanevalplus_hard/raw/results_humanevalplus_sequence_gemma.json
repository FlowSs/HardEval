It begins by addressing base cases where 'n' is zero or one, returning sequences [1] and [1, 3] respectively. From there, it initiates a list with values [1, 3]. The function then proceeds, while the list size is not 'n+1', to fill in the sequence by evaluating whether each index is even or odd. If even, the new value derives from 1 plus half the index; if odd, the value results from the sum of the two previous entries, an additional 1, and half the subsequent index. Additionally, it incorporates a Binet formula-based validation through a helper function to ensure each generated value fits the Fibonacci criteria before appending them to the list.

Initially, the 'FibFib' starts as follows: 'fibfib(0)' is set to 0, 'fibfib(1)' is also 0, and 'fibfib(2)' is 1. For n numbers beyond 2, it calculates each 'FibFib' term as the sum of fibfib(n-1), fibfib(n-2), and tri(n-3). A helper function named 'tri' within 'tri_fibfib' addresses tri(0) to return 1 and tri(1) to return 3. From the index of two and beyond, 'tri' evaluates its terms differently based on index parity: if the index is even, it uses '1 + i / 2', and if odd, it uses 'ans_prev + ans_prev_prev + 1 + (i + 1) / 2'. Iteratively, this function upholds and amends values to keep track of the previous calculations for both 'FibFib' and 'tri', finally outputting the desired n-th 'FibFib' number.\n```\n\nEnclose your solution in ```python and ```.
