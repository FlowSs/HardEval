Moreover, it employs a helper function (applying Binet's formula) to verify each candidate's Fibonacci validity before appending to the result list.

The main function first checks if n is zero or one to handle the base cases. For every number `i` starting from 2 until `n + 1`, the function checks whether the number is even or odd.

If not, it removes the last element from the sequence and restarts the process until the sequence size is `n+1`.\n\nPlease note that the Tri sequence refers to the sequence of triangular numbers, i.e., the sequence of the sum of the first i natural numbers for i = 1, 2, ...

After that, it initializes a sequence with the first two terms, 1 and 3. It then enters a loop that continues until the size of the sequence is at least `n + 1`. In each iteration of the loop, it calculates the next sequence term, which is based on whether the index is even or odd. For even indices, the term is a combination of the sum of 1 and half the index number, and the term at index `i - 1`. For odd indices, the term is the sum of the two previous terms, 1, and half of the incremented index number. After calculating the new term, it is appended to the sequence and the index `i` is incremented by 2.\n\nFinally, the function returns a list of the sequence terms that are also Fibonacci numbers.\n\nNote: The task is a bit misleading. The triangular numbers are not a part of Fibonacci sequence but there is a pattern that each even-indexed number in sequence can be considered as triangular number.\nFor more accurate approach, we may need to generate the triangular numbers up to n+1 and check it with Fibonacci sequence.<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>", "<\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.\n@@ Instruction\nWrite a Python solution to the following problem:\n```\nAuthor a function named 'tri_fib' which will produce a list of numbers extracted from the intersection of Tri and Fibonacci sequences up to the 'n + 1' member.

The second one, `fibonacci`, computes the n-th entry in the Fibonacci series where each element is the sum of the last four numbers.\n\nFinally, the function `prime_fib4` retrieves the n-th prime element in the Fibonacci series. It does this by continually incrementing a counter and checking each number if it is prime. As soon as a prime number is found, the counter `n` is decremented. When `n` is zero, the current number is returned.<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>", "<\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.\n@@ Instruction\nWrite a Python solution to the following problem:\n```\nConstruct the function 'prime_fib4', which retrieves the n-th entry in a series.

It then defines an outer generator function that uses `seq` to generate the terms of the sequence, and skips them if they are divisible by 7.\n\nThe `yield` keyword in Python is used to define a generator function. A generator function can generate a sequence of results over time, rather than computing them all at once and returning a list, as would be the case with a normal function.\n\nThe function `skip_7_tri()` returns the outer generator function as required. It can be used to generate terms of the sequence, omitting those divisible by 7, as follows:\n\n```python\nfor i in skip_7_tri():\n    if i > 100:  # generate terms until the first term > 100\n        break\n    print(i)\n```\n\nThis code prints the first few terms of the sequence, stopping when the term exceeds 100.<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>", "<\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.\n@@ Instruction\nWrite a Python solution to the following problem:\n```\nDevelop a function 'skip_7_tri' to produce a tri sequence where no elements are multiples of 7.

If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the function returns an empty list. If `n` is 1, the function returns a list with one element 1. For `n` greater than 1, the function starts by initializing a list with the first two elements 1 and 3. It then loops through the range from 2 to `n-1` (inclusive).  If the index `i` is divisible by 7 or `i+1` is divisible by 7, the function skips to the next iteration. If `i` is even, the function appends to the list the current element from the list plus 0.5*(`i`+1). If `i` is odd, the function appends to the list the sum of the current element from the list, the previous element from the list, 1 and 0.5*(`i`+1). Finally, the function returns the list.\n\nThis solution assumes you always want to skip `i` and `i+1` if any of them is divisible by 7.

When 'i' reaches 'n', the function exits the loop and returns the list 'ans'. It's important to remember to convert 'candidate_ans' into an integer before appending, as Python tends to perform division operations as floating numbers in some cases.<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>", "<\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.\n@@ Instruction\nWrite a Python solution to the following problem:\n```\nCraft a function dubbed 'skip_7_tri', which requires a non-negative integer 'n' as input.

In `is_prime(p)`, `math.isqrt(p)` is used to get the integer square root of `p` directly.\n\nThis implementation first generates the `n-th` prime Fibonacci number, then creates a list with this number as the first element. It then enters a loop where the next Fibonacci number will be either half of the current number or three times the current number plus 1. The loop ends when the number converges to 1. After forming the Collatz sequence, the program filters the sequence to create a list of odd numbers only. The list is then sorted and returned as the output.<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>", "<\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.\n@@ Instruction\nWrite a Python solution to the following problem:\n```\nImplement the function 'get_odd_prime_fib_collatz' which first find the 'n'-th prime of the Fibonacci sequence using an internal function 'prime_fib(n)', which employs 'is_prime(p)' to test for primes with the help of the 'math' module.

The 'i' loop breaks when 'p' divides 'i' to avoid unnecessary checks. The 'is_prime(p)' function checks if a number is a prime number. If the input is 2, it directly returns True. If the input is less than 2 or is divisible by 2, it returns False. The 'get_odd_prime_fib_collatz(n)' function gets the 'n'-th prime Fibonacci number, calculates the Collatz sequence for it, and returns a list of odd numbers sorted.<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>"]}}
